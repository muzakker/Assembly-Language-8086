# Assembly-Language-8086
This repository represents the code that was done a while ago, Spring-19. 
I was then a 3rd semester undergrad student. 
I took the Computer Organization & Architecture (COA) course, which was the first where I truly understood the usefulness of high-level programming languages.
In my first two semesters, I did C and CPP, both high-level programming languages, and things can be done easily.
For instance, adding two numbers in a typical C++ programming language will be like this: (ref: https://www.w3resource.com/cpp-exercises/basic/cpp-basic-exercise-4.php)

It gets even easier for programming languages like Python. But in assembly language, which is a low-level language, things get pretty messier than this.
This code is only for adding two single digits: (ref: http://code4beginner.com/8086/8086-Assembly-Language-Program-To-Add-Two-Single-Digit-Numbers.html)

It seems challenging at first, but I can assure you it is a lot more fun. 
For the first time, I felt like I was talking to the machine itself. I could see the changes bit by bit.
It's a surreal feeling.
